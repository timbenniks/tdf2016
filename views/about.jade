          h1 Tim's TDF 2016 dashboard
          p This dashboard is an anually recurring project that is developed about one month before the Tour De France (the most epic cycling event of the year). Every time I try to find some sort of live data feed, hack it, morph it, and use it in my own way. 

          p It mainly prevents me from watching television at work all day. Instead I have the live dashboard running on my second screen and enjoy its browser notifications.

          p The project evolves every year and tries to use bleeding edge technology. I don't care about your browser as this project is all about experimentation.

          p The project is open source and can be found on #[a(href="https://github.com/timbenniks/tdf2016", title="Tim's TDF 2016 on Github.", target="_blank") Github]. Visit my personal website on #[a(href="http://www.timbenniks.nl", title="Tim's personal website", target="_blank") timbenniks.com].
